Welcome to Murf Tweaks! This mod adds a few server-side tweaks to the game that I play with on my own world - this mod is essentially a 'whishlist' of small design changes that I will slowly grow over time.

### Mod List
- Persistent Enchantment - Replacement for Mending which removes XP repairing but prevents items from breaking at low durability by making the unusable, mimicing Elytra behaviour
- Snow Settings - Allows customisation for which blocks snow can land on, as well as a gamerule for enabling/disabling melting snow near torches

There are only two mods for now, but stay tuned for updates! :)

**Warning: Don't install this package mod AND the standalone mods at the same time, they will conflict and stuff will break.**
